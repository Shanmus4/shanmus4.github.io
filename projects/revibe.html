                SexTech needs specific tailoring for different genders because
                of the obvious reason - sexuality is different for different
                genders, it could be gentile regions, erogenous regions or
                simply preferences
              </li>
              <li>
                Online data showed a lot of paralyzed penis owners complaining
                about sexual frustration(more than women)
              </li>
              <li>
                Penis owners can achieve an erection in two ways(excluding drug
                based) - Mental stimulation, physical stimulation. Paraplegic
                penis owners complained about not able to achieve an erection
                thorugh mental stimulation.

            <p>
              We performed a content analysis within an online Reddit community
              to uncover and comprehend the challenges experienced by men with
              lower-body paralysis concerning sexual pleasure. <br />Reddit was
              an ideal platform due to its anonymity rules, considering the
              sensitive nature of the topic. The users we studied are regular
              people discussing their daily life problems, and they aren't
              usually involved in discussions as experts.

              After multiple discussions, we decided to come up with a sextoy,
              later on we got an idea to create an application to go along as
              well:

            <p>
              We brainstormed further, did branding ideas and came up with the

              <span style="font-weight: bold">ReVibe.</span> With whatever ideas
              we had collected, we decided to go further with the design because
              of the time constraints.

              We came up with an eggplant resembling mascot to add a superhero
              sidekick feel to the application. We even named him Eggbert.
              <br />
              The idea is to make the user of the product a hero, and this
              mascot as a sidekick to the hero's self pleasure journey with our
              product. <br />
              The application follows a quirky, superhero theme to which adds a
              personality to the entire product.
              <br />
              <br />
              The mighty Eggbert provides tips and tricks within the app for
              first time users, and also in the tutorial section.
